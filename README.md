## 2024 Windows

### Method 1: Using the Startup Folder
 

Place the file aliases.cmd in the Startup folder:

- Press Win + R, type shell:startup, and hit Enter. This opens the Startup folder for your user account.
- Copy your aliases.cmd file into this folder.
- Reboot or log off and log back in. The aliases.cmd file will run automatically at login, applying your aliases for that session.

Note: This will set up the aliases when the script runs, but they will only apply to Command Prompt sessions started afterward.
